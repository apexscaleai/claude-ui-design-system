description: Set up complete design system foundation for new React Native or Next.js project
---

I'll help you set up a complete design system foundation for your new project.

**What I'll create:**
1. Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, shadows, radius)
2. Project folder structure (atomic design)
3. Theme provider and hooks
4. Complete documentation
5. Apply your chosen design preset

**Please provide:**
1. What framework? (React Native or Next.js)
2. Which design preset would you like?
   - `minimalist-modern` - Clean, spacious, timeless
   - `glass-aesthetic` - Transparent, depth, modern
   - `bold-brutalist` - High contrast, geometric, bold
   - `soft-neumorphic` - Subtle shadows, tactile
   - `timeless-classic` - Professional, accessible
   - `bleeding-edge-experimental` - Latest 2025 trends

Once you provide this information, I'll use the `design-system-foundation` skill to set everything up for you.
