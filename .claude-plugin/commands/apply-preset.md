I'll help you apply or switch design presets for your UI components.

**Available Design Presets:**

1. **minimalist-modern** (Timeless)
   - Clean, spacious layouts
   - Monochromatic + single accent
   - Subtle shadows (0-10% opacity)

2. **glass-aesthetic** (Modern)
   - Transparency with backdrop blur
   - Layered depth
   - Soft glows and halos

3. **bold-brutalist** (Bleeding Edge)
   - High contrast (black/white/red/yellow)
   - Sharp corners (0 border radius)
   - Bold typography (700-900 weight)

4. **soft-neumorphic** (Subtle)
   - Soft shadows and highlights
   - Low contrast backgrounds
   - Rounded corners

5. **timeless-classic** (Professional)
   - Balanced, professional
   - High accessibility
   - Conservative colors

6. **bleeding-edge-experimental** (Innovative)
   - Latest 2025 trends
   - Experimental interactions
   - Cutting-edge animations

**What would you like to do?**
- Apply preset to new component?
- Switch preset for existing component?
- Convert entire app between presets?

Provide the preset name and component/file, and I'll use the `design-preset-system` skill to apply it.
