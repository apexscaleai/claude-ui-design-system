description: Refactor existing UI component with modern design principles and design preset
---

I'll help you refactor existing UI code to apply modern design principles.

**What I'll do:**
1. Analyze your current component implementation
2. Apply design tokens from your chosen preset
3. Improve visual hierarchy and spacing
4. Enhance accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)
5. Add thoughtful micro-interactions
6. Maintain all existing functionality

**Please provide:**
1. The component code you want to refactor
2. Which design preset to apply?
   - `minimalist-modern` - Clean, spacious, timeless
   - `glass-aesthetic` - Transparent, depth, modern
   - `bold-brutalist` - High contrast, geometric, bold
   - `soft-neumorphic` - Subtle shadows, tactile
   - `timeless-classic` - Professional, accessible
   - `bleeding-edge-experimental` - Latest 2025 trends

I'll use the `ui-refactoring-workflow` skill to transform your component while preserving functionality.
